# Data Driven Best Indian Test XI (2013-2024) | Cricket Analytics Using Python
This project selects a **Best Test cricket XI using real performance data scraped from `ESPN Cricinfo` instead of opinions**. Players are evaluated by role, comparing batters, bowlers, all-rounders, and keepers based on impact and consistency. Senior and Junior Players as well as Pacers and spinners are judged separately to maintain fairness.

Built using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib). Visual comparisons support every selection, and the final squad is created only after filtering and validating top performers.

The aim is simple: let statistics decide the team.
